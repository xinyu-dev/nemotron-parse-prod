They approximately spanned three quadrants of the space.

Comparison of stubby versus other blocks revealed a network that contained multiple patches selective for stubby objects (Fig. 4c). Electrophysiology targeted to two of these patches revealed cells that were strongly selective for stubby objects (Fig. 2d), whose preferred axes occupied the previously unrepresented quadrant (Fig. 4b, magenta dots). The general properties of the stubby network were very similar to those of the NML, face, and body networks. Population similarity matrices showed increased view invariance in the most anterior stubby patch (Fig. 3a, b (bottom), Extended Data Fig. 3f). Cells in the stubby network also showed ramp-shaped timing along their preferred axes (Fig. 3c (bottom), Extended Data Fig. 5a) and flat timing along orthogonal axes (Extended Data Fig. 5e). Thus, the hypothesis that IT is organized according to the first two dimensions of object space revealed a second new shape network."

An overlay of the four networks onto coronal slices and a cortical flat map revealed a remarkably ordered progression (Fig. 4c, d; see Extended Data Fig. 7 for response time courses from each patch). There is a clear sequence from body to face to stubby to NML in both hemispheres that is repeated in the same order in posterior, middle, and anterior IT. This pattern was consistent across animals (Fig. 4c, d) and confirmed by quantitative analysis of the linear fit between patch-ordered label and cortical location of patch peak (P < 10\u221218 for posterior, middle, and anterior IT, Fig. 4e\u2013g).
